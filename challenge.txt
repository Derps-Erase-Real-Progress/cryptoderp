	We challenge the intrigued reader to attempt to find a fast way of decyphering data encyphered with this algorithm on DCPU-16 without access to the original (or derivative seeds.) As of April 13, 2012, I have not been able to find an obvious weakness in the algorithm, but finding and publishing weaknesses in algorithms is essential to the development of secure algorithms.
	As such, I have provided a set (with more to come) of data cyphered with the algorithm as of April 13, 2012, without the keys, to test breakin attempts on. The successful answers will be obvious.
